Removes the @user autocomplete feature from the Gutenberg block editor.

By default on Gutenberg, when you type `@`, the block editor performs a search through the users of your WordPress install to suggest you to "@-mention" them (see animated screenshot below for a demo of the default feature).

It can be annoying when you are writing email addresses in the editor. This plugin removes the feature from the editor.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin and activate it in your WordPress Admin.
2. That's all! No settings needed.
